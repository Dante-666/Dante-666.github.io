# About (Section and Page)

# About Section
blurb:
  I am a passionate programmer who has been in the industry for about five years now. I left the industry briefly to pursue a Master's program. I took up pragmatic and diverse courses/projects like Image Processing, Deep Learning, Robotics, Computer Vision, Computational Photography, and Computer Graphics.<br><br> I am an individual contributor at present, but I am looking for more challenging and mentoring roles as the next step in my career. I am an expert Linux user, and I have invested primarily in the C++ programming language because of the domains it is applied in. Game Development is one such domain, and it has always intrigued me since childhood. I pursue Game Development as a hobby as it's a great platform to try out reusable design while keeping it fun.
