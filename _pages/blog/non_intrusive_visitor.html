	<h3>The Visitor Pattern</h3>
	<p> The <a class="text-dark" href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor">Visitor</a>
	is a behavioral pattern that is used to apply different algorithms to a 
	<a class="text-dark" href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite">Composite</a> 
	tree structure. It is mainly used to parse the tree in various ways to achieve different outcomes. 
	The Visitor separates the algorithm from the objects that they operate on. It can be implemented 
	in different ways depending upon the design options and choices available at the instance.
	</p>
	<object data="/uml/b6814f2d53fa6941ed9430968a5a4476.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="plantuml"></object>
	<p>The most straightforward implementation is highly intrusive in which the base composite class 
	is modified to have a virtual visit method and the visit behavior is delegated to the subclasses
	for a particular algorithm, say printing. This is a bad design choice as the composite tree may 
	have to be parsed differently and not just for printing. If we stick to this design choice, we 
	would have to modify the composite classes again with virtual methods for different algorithms 
	and this isn't good from a code maintenance point of view. If we recall, the Visitor was supposed
	to separate the algorithm from the objects and it seems like it's not doing its job quite well.
	</p>
	<object data="/uml/db1e5b9f04aee0d29bebf4a5cd9bcf11.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="plantuml"></object>
	<p>The next choice is a reflective visitor, which behaves more like a visitor in which the 
	algorithm is separate from the data. This visitor relies heavily on recursion and RTTI and 
	does a lot of condition-decision in a single file. The readability and maintenance aspect 
	of this approach is clumsy.
	</p>
	<p>Can we do any better? Implementing the visitor for a strongly typed language such as C++ 
	can be tricky. From the UML diagrams, the problem is apparent. The concrete Visitors need 
	to know the base-type of the object to perform different operations. We can't resort to 
	method overloading since it would default to the base composite class. 
	To avoid this problem, we use a
	<a class="text-dark" href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor-double-dispatch">
	double dispatch</a> visitor.
	</p>
	<object data="/uml/00b5af1b65716ace64914545c03e0a3d.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="plantuml"></object>
	<p>This beautiful trick uses a conjunction of dynamic binding and method overloading to
	figure out the composite type. It then uses this information to call the appropriate method 
	for the object type.
	</p>
	<p>Although neat, it also creates a cyclic dependency between the composite objects and 
	the Visitor objects, which could be deficient in code compilation and maintenance. An Acyclic
	Visitor invented by
	<a class="text-dark" href="https://condor.depaul.edu/dmumaugh/OOT/Design-Principles/acv.pdf">
	Robert C. Martin</a> 
	solves this problem but introduces dynamic_cast to the 
	equation with its own set of problems. The implementation relies heavily on the use case. 
	I am more concerned with instances where modifying the Composite may not be an option, and the
	scenario demands non-intrusive visitors. Let's see if we can make it better.

	<h3>Non Intrusion</h3>
	<p> I've taken the below composite from Dmitri Nesteruk's course 
	<a class="text-dark" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/patterns-cplusplus/">
	Design Patterns in Modern C++</a>
	on Udemy. I've used the same structure for the UMLs above to maintain consistency. 
	I am using structs here to avoid unnecessary getter setter methods, which are 
	trivial and should be implemented.
	</p>
	{% gist 436b7bc848ce57adaf185c36e6adf682 %}
	<p>
	I have decoupled the dependency of Composite objects on Visitor class using polymorphism and
	<a class="text-dark" href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/typeid">typeid</a>,
	which still uses RTTI but dispatches the requests internally via the Visitor base class. 
	This approach reduces compilation times by making the Composite objects independent of the 
	Visitor objects. You can notice that the <i class="text-dark">accept(Visitor&)</i> 
	methods are abandoned in the Composite. It only requires polymorphism among the Composite 
	classes otherwise, typeid will return the base type for every subtype. 
	That's why I've added a virtual destructor in the base Composite.
	</p>
	{% gist 4a5a6416cb1c62ef316cf7a5dd813d34 %}
	<p> We are still going to dispatch twice, but the dispatch responsibility is completely
	on the Visitor base class. I construct a <i class="text-dark">map</i> between the 
	<i class="text-dark">type_index</i> and a <i class="text-dark">function</i>.
	In the <i class="text-dark">accept(Expression&)</i> method, we figure out the type of the 
	object and if the type exists in the map, we call the function associated with that type. 
	The function related to the type_index needs to cast the expression to the 
	appropriate type. We already know this from the typeid and the casting is performed using generics.
	</p>
	{% gist df16a42af307d235f145ab5f9466578f %}
	<p> The function <i class="text-dark">Visitor::castAndHandle(Expression&)</i> is generic and it
	static_casts the Expression for the typeid it is associated with and call the
	polymorphic <i class="text-dark">handle</i> method.
	To make the correct associations, we bind the template specialization of <i class="text-dark">castAndHandle</i>
	in the <i class="text-dark">Vistor::Visitor()</i> constructor associated with the type_index.
	</p>
	<p> I've deliberately separated the <i class="text-dark">Handler</i> class to make this code more reliable. 
	Suppose a new composite <i class="text-dark">Division</i> was introduced and the client made some changes and 
	included these Expressions in the tree. We won't see any compilation failures, but an 
	error will be logged when the code is run in the <i class="text-dark">Vistor::accept(Expression&)</i>
	method, notifying this change to the developer. Then we only have to update two members: the 
	<i class="text-dark">Visitor::Visitor()</i> to insert new types and the <i class="text-dark">Handler</i>
	to include new polymorphic methods for the new type of expression. Then, 
	update ConcreteVisitors and compile only the Visitor module to add support for the new subclass.
	</p>
	{% gist 02323786a50e23494510966fad826e35 %}
	<p> Let us see two concrete implementations of the Visitor which use this approach. The 
	casting duties have already been delegated to the base Visitor class and the Concrete classes 
	need to handle the type of Expression based on function polymorphism.
	</p>
	{% gist a80529f5c55eb5dd04daa394d3d7f372 %}
	<p> The 
	<i class="text-dark">Printer</i> and 
	<i class="text-dark">Evaluator</i> are two types of concrete visitors which print and 
	evaluate the Expression tree. These would naturally have to be modified if new Expressions 
	are introduced. The complete
	<a class="text-dark" href="https://github.com/Dante-666/DesignPatterns/blob/main/visitor.cpp">
	source code</a>
	source code is here. It's in a single file and is a simple toy example, but ideally, every class
	will be in its separate file and doing that will reduce the compilation time significantly.

	<p>The dependency of Composite on the Visitor class has been severed with this approach. 
	There may be something I am overlooking here, but given the constraint of using a non-intrusive 
	visitor, this seems like a good approach. Let me know of any downsides to this approach by 
	contacting me from the homepage.
