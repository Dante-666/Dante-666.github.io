	<h3>The Visitor Pattern</h3>
	<p> The <a class="text-dark" href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor">Visitor</a>
	is a behavioral pattern that is used to apply different algorithms to a 
	<a class="text-dark" href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite">Composite</a> 
	tree structure. It is mainly used to parse the tree in different ways to achieve different
	outcomes. This is intended to separate the algorithm from the objects that they operate on. It
	can be implemented in different ways depending upon the design options and choices available
	at the instance.</p>
	<object data="/uml/b6814f2d53fa6941ed9430968a5a4476.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="plantuml"></object>i
	<p>The simplest implementation is extremely intrusive in which the base composite
	classe is modified to have a virtual visit method and the visit behavior is delegated to the
	subclasses for a particular algorithm, say printing. This is a bad design choice as the composite
	tree may be parsed in a different manner and not just for printing, and if we stick to this
	design choice, we would have to modify the composite classes again with virtual methods for
	different algorithms and this is bad for code maintainence. If we recall, the Visitor was 
	supposed to separate the algorithm from the objects and it seems like it's not doing its job
	quite well.</p>
	<object data="/uml/db1e5b9f04aee0d29bebf4a5cd9bcf11.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="plantuml"></object>
	<p>The next choice is a reflective visitor which behaves more like a visitor in which
	the algorithm is separate from the data. But this visitor relies heavily on RTTI and
	the casts make it a bit slower. In some time-critical parsing applications, this
	might not be a very good implemetation.
	</p>
	<p>Can we do any better? Implementing the visitor for a strongly typed language
	such as C++ can be tricky. From the UML diagrams, the problem is obvious. The concrete
	Visitors need to know the basetype of the object to perform different operations.
	We can't resort to method overloading since it would default to the base composite class.
	To avoid this problem, we use a 
	<a class="text-dark" href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor-double-dispatch">
	double dispatch</a> visitor.
	</p>
	<object data="/uml/00b5af1b65716ace64914545c03e0a3d.svg" type="image/svg+xml" class="plantuml"></object>
	<p>This beautiful trick uses a conjunction of dynamic binding and method overloading
	to figure out the type of the composite and then uses this information to call the 
	appropriate method for the object type.
	</p>
	<p>Although neat, it also creates a cyclic dependency between the composite objects
	and the Visitor objects which could be bad in certain scenarios especially when it
	comes to code compilation and maintainence. There is a Acyclic Visitor invented
	by <a class="text-dark" href="https://condor.depaul.edu/dmumaugh/OOT/Design-Principles/acv.pdf">
	Robert C. Martin</a> which solves this problem but introduces dynamic_cast to the
	equation which has its own set of problems. It is obvious that the implementation relies
	heavily on the use case and I will discuss the case where modifying the Composite may not
	be an option and thus a Non-intrusive visitor is desired. Let's see if we can make it better.

	<h3>Non Intrusion</h3>
	<p> I've taken the below composite from Dmitri Nesteruk's course 
	<a class="text-dark" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/patterns-cplusplus/">
	Design Patterns in Modern C++</a> on Udemy. I've used the same structure for the UMLs above
	to maintain consistency.

	<h3>Future Work</h3>
	<p> I have built this to simply showcase this as a complete project built from start to finish.
	If people actually like this and require some new types of dice, then I can think about including
	those as in-app purchases to get some monetization. I have absolutely no idea on how to integrate
	the purchases with Google Play Store which would be a good experience in itself.
