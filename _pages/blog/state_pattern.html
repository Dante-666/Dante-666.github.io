	<h3>The State Pattern</h3>
	<p> <a class="text-dark" href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state">State</a>
	is a behavioral design pattern that modifies the behavior of an object based on the current
	state it is in.</p>

	<h3>Future Work</h3>
	<p> I have built this to simply showcase this as a complete project built from start to finish.
	If people actually like this and require some new types of dice, then I can think about including
	those as in-app purchases to get some monetization. I have absolutely no idea on how to integrate
	the purchases with Google Play Store which would be a good experience in itself.
